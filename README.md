  ### Review
  - **Dynamic**: *at runtime*.
  - **Static**: *before runtime*.
  - **Syntax**: the correct *structure* of code.
  - **Semantics**: the meaning *meaning* of code.
  - A (**formal**) **language** is a set of *strings*.
    - Not the same as a programming language!
    - Examples of formal languages:
      - The set of all lexemes in some category, for some programming language (e.g. the set of all legal C++ identifiers)
      - The set of all syntactically correct programs, in some programming language (e.g., the set of all syntactically correct Lua programs)
  - **Alphabet**: the set of characters that may appear in the strings.
  - To describe a formal language with a **generator**
    - Are easier to use, and is something that can produce the strings in a formal language, all of them, nothing else
  - To describe a formal language with a **recognizer**
    - Recognizers are more useful, and are a way of determining whether a given string lies in the formal language.
  - It's common to start with a constructor, then construct a recognizer based on it.
  - A (**phrase-structure**) **grammar** is a kind of language generator, which needs;
    - A collection of **terminal symbols**, our alphabet
    - A collection of **nonterminal symbols**, which turn into something else. 
    - And usually one nonterminal symbol is the **start symbol**
    - A **grammar** is a list of one or more *productions*
    - A **production** is a rule for altering strings by substituting one substring for another, made of terminal and nonterminal strings.
  - The result is a **derivation** of the final string
  - The final string will usually consist of *only* terminal strings.
  - FOR CLASS: Terminal (a b x ), nonterminal (C Q S), start symbol (S)

  ### The Chomsky Hierarchy
  - The Chomsky Hierarchy consists of four categories of languages.
    | Language Category | | Generator | Recognizer
    | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | Number | Name | | |
    | Type 3 | Regular | Grammer in which each production has one of the following forms. A -> ε, A -> b, A -> bC. Another kind of generator: *regular* expressions (covered later). | Deterministic Finite Automation, Think: Program that uses a small, fixed amount of memory. |
    | Type 2 | Context-Free | Grammar in which the left-hand side of each production consists of a single nonterminal. A -> [anything]. | Nondeterministic Push-Down Automation. Think: Finite Automaton + Stack (roughly) |
    | Type 1 | Context-Sensitive | Don't worry about it. | Don't worry about it. |
    | Type 0 | Computably Enumerable | Grammar (no restrictions). | Turing Machine. Thik: Computer Program | 
  - The Chomsky Heirarchy is contained in the next, So every regular language, is context-free, etc.
  - A **Regular Language** is one hat can be generated by a grammar is the above described forms.
    - Alternative generator: **regular expression** (covered later)
    - Can be recognized by a **deterministic finite automaton**
    - Describe lexeme categories
    - Ecompass the level of computation required for **lexical analysis**: breaking a program into lexemes
    - Used in text **search/replace**
  - A **context-free language** can be recognized by a **nondeterministic push-down automaton**
    - These languages encompass the level of computation required for **parsing**
    - Determine whether a program is syntactically correct, and how it is structured.
  - A **context-sensitive language**, we generally do not care.
    - Not a fruitful thought of Chomsky
    - The recognizer for this type of language is called a *linear bounded automaton*
  - A **computably enumerable language** is one described by grammar with no restrictions on the production.
    - The recognizer for this would be a **turing machine**.
    - These languages encompass the things that computer programs can do
    - These languages are **recursively enumerable language**, derived from a branch of mathematics called *recursively enumberable language*

  ### Regular Languages
  - The smallest of the Chomsky Heirarchy.
  - Regular languages have two important applications
    1. lexical analysis, or lexing.
    2. text search/replace
  - Regular Grammar production rules will be in this fashion; 
    1. A -> ε
    2. A -> b
    3. A -> bC
  - To see if regular grammar is correct, you can look into **Pumping Lemma for regular language**
  - A **deterministic finite automaton** (Latin plural "**automata**") or **DFA**
    - Is a recognizer for regular languages.
    - Consists of a finite collection of **states** and **transitions**
      1. One state is the start state
      2. Some states my be accepting states
      3. Each transition begins at a state, ends at a state, and is associated with a terminal symbol
      4. for each character, each state has exactly one transition leaving it
    - The set of all inputs that are accepted, is the language recognized by the DFA
    - Languages that are recognized by DFA's are precisely the regular languages
  - **Zero is an even number.** But a string with no characters (ε) is not a permissible identifier.

  ### Course Objectives
  1. Understand the concepts of syntax and semantics
  2. Understand implementing lexical analysis, parsing and interpretation
  3. Understand various types of programmiing languages
  4. Understand programming language features and the forms they take
  5. Be familiar with the impact of choosing a programming language
  6. Develop a basic proficiency in multiple programming languages

  - We will learn how to use
    1. Lua (ZeroBrane Studio)
    2. Haskell (GHC)
    3. Forth (GNU version of Gforth)
    4. Scheme (DrRacket)
    5. Prolog (SWI-Prolog)

  - We will focus on;
    - Syntax: correct structure
    - Semantics: meaning
    - And features of programming languages
  - There will be;
    - 13 quizzes, 7 homework assignments, and 2 exams
  
  ### Basic Concepts of Course
  - Specification: is a precise description
  - Dynamic: Refers to things that happen at runtime
  - Static: Refers to things that happen before runtime
  - Syntax: is the correct structure of code
  - Semantics: is the meaning of code
    - Static Semantics: are issues that occur before runtime
    - Dynamic Semantics: are issues that occur during runtime
  - A string is a finite sequence of zero or more characters
  - Formal Language is a set of strings
    - We can denote an empty string "" as ε (Greek epsilon)
  - There are two broad categories of ways to describe formal languages;
    - **Generators**: are something that can produce the strings in a language
    - **Recognizer**: is a way of determining if a given string lies in the language
  - A **Phrase-Structure grammar** (or just grammar) is a kind of language generator. It's a list of one or more productions.
  - A **production** is a rule for altering strings by substituting one substring for another. These are made of terminal and nonterminal symbols
  - **Terminal symbols** are what we use to compose our grammar
  - **NonTerminal symbols** are like variables that eventually turn into something else. One nonterminal symbol is the **start symbol**

  ### Derivations
  - A **derivation** is the result of strings left by the final strings
  - If we start with "S"
    - Grammar rules are: S -> xSy, S -> ε
    - We can turn this into an infinite multiple of 
  
  - Grammar containing  strings = {ε}
  - Grammar containing
