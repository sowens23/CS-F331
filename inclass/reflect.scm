; Very Simple Scheme Reflection


; ======================================================================
; BEGIN code you can ignore, to deal with weird issues involving "eval".


; For reasons involving namespaces, the way we use "eval" in the REPL
; does not work in a program. The following code allows us to call
; "eval" here, but we must add a second argument to eval: ns, which
; represents a namespace. So where we would do "(eval xyz)" in the REPL,
; we use "(eval xyz ns)" here.
(define-namespace-anchor anc)
(define ns (namespace-anchor->namespace anc))


; END code you can ignore. Start paying attention again. :-)
